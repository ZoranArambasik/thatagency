										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b><i>Royal Automobile Club of Queensland (RACQ) increases contract workforce by 10 percent with Lisa Kennedy’s talent acquisition services<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></b></p>
<p>When Greg Booker joined RACQ as their Digital Automation and Innovation Executive, he found it hard to find and secure high-calibre IT talent in the admittedly small Brisbane market. After reaching out to talent acquisition expert Lisa Kennedy for help, RACQ boosted the amount of contract workers in their technology and digital sector by 10 percent, resulting in an extra 20 to 25 employees at their peak period. By quickly filling these valuable roles in a seamless and cost-effective manner, RACQ saw improved operational efficiency and increased employee satisfaction.</p>
<p><i>“Her ability to then place the people she finds into a role and then look after them is second to none. Lisa really is a standout IT recruiter who is truly dedicated to both her clients and the job seekers she represents.”</i></p>
<p>To achieve these outcomes, Lisa first consulted Greg on his recruitment needs, which covered a wide range of roles from digital to insurance skillsets. By utilising her strong communication and talent acquisition skills, Lisa drew from her far-reaching network to narrow down a list of the best candidates. In fact, Lisa personally travelled to Brisbane on a monthly basis to conduct interviews over the phone, through video link and in-person, making sure each candidate met RACQ’s highest standards.</p>
<p><i>“The thing about Lisa is that she genuinely manages the people she places in roles. Because she stays in touch with them, we call on her if issues come up and we need her to handle the situations. And she does.”</i></p>
<p>Even after securing these roles, Lisa maintained regular communication with both Greg and each contractor she introduced to RACQ. She effectively resolved disputes, gathered constructive feedback from management, and gave workers the support they needed to achieve their professional goals – even if it means encouraging them to pursue permanent roles, or even vice versa. This level of reassurance meant that contract workers could rely on Lisa for support at all times, resulting in increased company morale and employee satisfaction.</p>
<p><i>“From when I introduced her at RACQ to the next time I looked up, she had eight to ten people calling on her and was fulfilling valuable roles. So, there’s no need for any micromanagement with Lisa. Her professionalism works well both ways, for her and the organisation.”</i></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After studying politics in the UK, Ursula Phillips fell in love with and married an Australian, before shifting gears and moving down-under permanently. During a brief stint as program manager at Lion Nathan Australia, proud managers of household beverage names including Tooheys, James Squire and Little Creatures, Ursula wanted to start a new chapter in her senior career.</p>
<p><i>“That’s when I met Tom. A friend introduced me to Tom because he’d placed her previously, and she thought he could help me find a new role.”</i></p>
<p>After meeting with Tom over a coffee, Ursula was confident that Tom had a genuine desire to help find and secure her dream role. That’s when the perfect position came up at Digital Business (division of NTT Ltd, formerly Oakton). From there, Tom got the ball rolling and helped get her foot in the door with an interview – which she passed with flying colours.</p>
<p><i>“At the time, I didn’t have a lot of tenure – I had less than two years of experience. But Oakton trusted Tom and his judgement, and they interviewed me because he recommended me as someone worth talking to.”</i></p>
<p>Ursula spent three years at Oakton, and in that time, she got to know a number of colleagues who had also been placed in the company by Tom. From there, the impossible happened and Ursula took a major step forward in her career, becoming the Chief Information Officer (CIO) at PepsiCo.</p>
<p>As part of her new role, Ursula was responsible for securing new talent for PepsiCo’s IT division. Based on Tom’s strong background in IT talent management, Ursula engaged him as their recruiter Tom oversaw the whole recruitment process for PepsiCo’s IT division. By drawing from over 16 years of experience in the Australian IT landscape, both as a techie and talent acquisition expert, Tom knew what kind of specialist IT skills each recruit needed for their roles. As a result, Tom was able to quickly and easily fill each role, and he made sure that each recruitwas happy and satisfied with their position – while making sure PepsiCo were achieving their goals too.</p>
<p>Best of all? It was all thanks to the positive word-of-mouth, spread by those who had secured their own dream roles thanks to Tom’s diligent efforts.</p>
<p><i>“I always send people to Tom when they’re looking for jobs, because he’s the sort of recruiter who stays in touch with people like me over the long term. This means he knows when a CIO or a company is developing a new role or there’s an interesting project in the works.”</i></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>IT professional scores ‘hat trick’ by securing 3 dream roles over 14 years with That Agency’s Tom Huckerby</b></p>
<p>Since first meeting Tom Huckerby, talent acquisition expert and co-founder of That Agency, way back in 2006, Edbert Prawiranegara has achieved massive success in his career. His most recent role is Technical Delivery Lead at Recreo Financial, an Australian-based provider of digital administration services for the superannuation and investment industries, where he leads a 30 strong team of people on a range of projects. Tom initially presented this opportunity to Edbert back in 2014, where he has remained since and never looked back.</p>
<p><i>“Tom isn’t your average recruitment agent. From the moment we met, he was all about getting to know me, my goals and what I was looking for in my career. Tom is so easy to talk to and he really listens and takes the time to get to know you. He doesn’t just want to place people in any job. He makes sure that both parties are satisfied.”</i></p>
<p>But it wasn’t always this way. Before working with Tom, Edbert had a number of recruitment experiences that left him uncomfortable and unhappy, ultimately losing faith in recruitment agencies as a whole.</p>
<p><i>“I applied for one job online and then the agents interviewed me via a phone conference in a really formal process. They didn’t give me a clear understanding of the company, and so when I met the employer, I knew it wasn’t going to be a good interview or fit for me.”</i></p>
<p>What sets Tom apart from your average IT recruiter? He always prioritises matching the right role for the right person. He takes the time to understand not just the job seeker, but explain to them what the client is looking for, what the role entails, and how the organisation works. More importantly, Tom only presents job offers where he’s confident you can make a valuable contribution to the organisation. As a tech lead, Edbert states this is what’s made him (and the companies he’s worked for) so happy and fulfilled over the years. After all, when you walk into an interview with a potential employer, your number one asset is information. Knowing who your new boss is going to be – not just the organisation, but the person you’ll be answering to – is fundamental. After all, that is the person you’ll be working with day in and day out, and the one you’ll be answering to.</p>
<p><i>“That’s the thing about Tom. He goes out of his way to tell you who the boss is and how they like to run things and what they’re trying to do. Because of the way Tom always makes sure my skills are in line with what the client is looking for, I never walk into an interview feeling unprepared or worried about the outcome.”</i></p>
